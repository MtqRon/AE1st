## The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## チャレンジ
タイタニック号の沈没は歴史上もっとも(infamous shipwrecks）です．
1912年，4月15日彼女の(maiden voyage)中，広義の懸念「沈まない」(RMS)タイタニック (sank) 氷山と衝突．
残念ながら，そこには全員が乗り込めるだけの十分な救命ボートがなく，結果的に2224人の乗客とクルーを除いた1502人が死亡しました．
この出来事において，生存を含むいくつかの要素の欠落があり，それはいくつかのグループの生き延びた人間に似たものがあることです．
このチャレンジでは，「どの人間が生き残りやすそうか」という課題にたいして，乗客のデータをもとに答えをだす推論モデルを作成してもらいます．
