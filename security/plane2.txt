Normally, we use the standard basis, but it is also possible to use other bases (the components used for representation).
When the basis (the components for representation) changes, the matrix representation (the blueprint) of a linear map also changes.
The representation matrix is uniquely determined only after specifying the bases for both the input and output sides.
Even if the basis (components) and the representation matrix (blueprint) change, the operation being performed (the final product) remains the same.
