A real symmetric matrix can always be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix.
In particular, when the eigenvalues are non-repeated, the corresponding eigenvectors are already orthogonal, so an orthogonal matrix can be formed simply by normalizing each eigenvector.
Even in the case of repeated eigenvalues, it is possible to construct an orthogonal matrix by applying the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to the eigenvectors corresponding to the repeated eigenvalues.
